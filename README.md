| `docker-compose up -d`        | Start MongoDB database in Docker container                         |
| `./gradlew :server:run`       | Start the server locally                                           |
| `docker run -p 8080:8080 rps-api` | Run the application in Docker container                        |

### Docker Setup

The project includes Docker support for both the application and MongoDB:

1. **MongoDB Container**:
  - Run `docker-compose up -d` to start MongoDB
  - MongoDB runs on port 27017
  - Credentials are configured in the docker-compose.yml file

2. **Application Container**:
  - Uses a multi-stage build process
  - Build stage uses Gradle 8.5 with JDK 17
  - Runtime stage uses OpenJDK 17 slim image
  - Application runs on port 8080

You can run the full stack (MongoDB + Application) using:

```bash
# Start MongoDB
docker-compose up -d

# Build and run the application
docker build -t rps-api .
docker run --network host -p 8080:8080 rps-api
```

## API Endpoints with Use Cases

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **POST /login**
- **Purpose**: Authenticate a player and generate a JWT token for secure access.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "",
    "name": "Ali"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "token": "jwt-token-string",
    "playerId": "unique-player-id",
    "name": "Ali"
  }
  ```
- **Use Cases**:
  - Authentication before joining the game. üîê
  - Returns JWT token needed for authenticated endpoints. üé´

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **POST /join**
- **Purpose**: Allows a player to join the game. 
- **Authorization**: Requires JWT token in the Authorization header.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "player-id",
    "name": "Ali"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  - **201 Created**:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "unique-player-id",
      "name": "Ali"
    }
    ```
    Player successfully joined. ‚úÖ
  - **409 Conflict**:
    ```
    Game is full
    ```
    No slots available for new players. üö´

- **Use Cases**:
  - A new player wants to join the waiting lobby before the game starts. üèÅ
  - Uses player ID and token from login for secure access. üîë

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **GET /players**
- **Purpose**: List all players currently in the game. üë•
- **Response Example**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "player1-id",
      "name": "Ali"
    },
    {
      "id": "player2-id",
      "name": "Alya"
    }
  ]
  ```
- **Use Cases**:
  - Players can view the list of participants currently available. üëÄ
  - Useful to verify if other players have joined before starting the game. ‚úÖ

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **GET /leaderboard**
- **Purpose**: Retrieve the current game leaderboard showing player wins.
- **Response Example**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "player": "Ali",
      "wins": 7
    },
    {
      "player": "Alya",
      "wins": 5
    },
    {
      "player": "Tie",
      "wins": 2
    }
  ]
  ```
- **Use Cases**:
  - Track player performance across multiple games. üìä
  - See who has the most wins in the current session. üèÜ

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **WebSocket /game**
- **Purpose**: Connect players to the game and perform real-time interactions. üí¨
- **How It Works**:
  - Players establish a WebSocket connection.
  - Players send their moves (`ROCK`, `PAPER`, or `SCISSORS`) via the WebSocket along with their player ID.
  - Once both players send their moves, the server determines the result and broadcasts it to all clients.

- **Play Move Example (Client)**:
  ```json
  {
    "playerId": "unique-player-id",
    "move": "ROCK"
  }
  ```
- **Result Example (Server Response)**:
  ```json
  {
    "player1Id": "player1-id",
    "player2Id": "player2-id",
    "player1Move": "ROCK",
    "player2Move": "SCISSORS",
    "winner": "player1-id"
  }
  ```

- **Use Cases**:
  - Enables real-time game moves between two players. ü§ù
  - Broadcasts game results to both clients. üåü
  - Once the game is over, the session resets for a fresh match! üîÑ

---

## üöÄ Use Case Scenarios

1. **Authentication & Joining a Game**
  - Players first authenticate to receive a JWT token, then join using this secure token.
  - The token ensures that only authorized players can interact with the game.

2. **Viewing Players**
  - Players or admins fetch the list of current participants to monitor the lobby.

3. **Tracking Performance** 
  - The leaderboard provides a competitive element, letting players see who's winning the most games.

4. **Real-time Game**
  - Leveraging WebSocket for real-time interactions makes the game dynamic and engaging.

5. **Broadcasting Game Results**
  - Players receive instant results and can restart for a new match once both have played.

## CLI Client üöß (Under Construction)

The project includes a command-line interface (CLI) client that interacts with the API, allowing players to:

- Login and authenticate
- Join games
- List current players
- Play the game through the command line via interactive prompts

### CLI Features & Libraries

The CLI is built using several excellent Kotlin libraries:

- **[Clikt](https://github.com/ajalt/clikt)** (v5.0.3) - Powerful, flexible, and intuitive command-line interface parser
- **[Mordant](https://github.com/ajalt/mordant)** (v3.0.2) - Colorful terminal text styling with ANSI colors and markdown support
- **[Ktor Client](https://ktor.io/docs/client.html)** - HTTP client for API communication
  - CIO Engine - Coroutine-based I/O client
  - Content Negotiation - JSON serialization/deserialization
  - WebSockets - Bidirectional real-time communication
  - Auth - JWT authentication
